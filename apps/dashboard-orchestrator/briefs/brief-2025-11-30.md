# Daily Intelligence Brief - 2025-11-30



# 📊 Executive Summary  
• **DXY at Make-or-Break 99.20 Support:** A confirmed breakdown (<99.20 close) triggers global liquidity expansion → BTC +$2K-$3K immediate move (70% probability).  
• **ETH/BTC Ratio Breakout (0.0332):** Sustained altcoin rotation signal implies 12-15% ETH outperformance vs BTC next 7 days (historical beta 1.4x).  
• **Gold Strength Defies Real Yields:** $4,218 gold amid stable DXY reveals institutional inflation hedging - precursor to risk asset rally (2011 & 2019 parallels).  

**🎯 Contrarian Thesis:** Consensus views Gold's rally as overbought, BUT it's actually front-running a DXY collapse and crypto breakout (8.5/10 conviction).
