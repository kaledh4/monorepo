    "top_signal": "USD/JPY: CRITICAL SHOCK",
    "why_it_matters": "The Japanese Yen is a primary funding currency for global carry trades and a key barometer of risk appetite. A 'CRITICAL SHOCK' event indicates a potential rapid unwinding of these trades or a significant monetary policy divergence, creating violent ripples across global liquidity. This signal directly challenges the placid 'LOW' overall risk score, suggesting deep, unseen currents are moving beneath the market surface.",
    "cross_dashboard_convergence": "A significant divergence is the dominant theme today. The SHIELD's low aggregate risk score is a lagging indicator, dangerously masking the forward-looking stress signaled by the USD/JPY shock. This macro tension is reflected in the MAP's negative TASI mood and is likely a key driver for the COIN's bearish momentum as capital de-risks from high-beta assets. With the FRONTIER showing no new technological narratives to attract capital, liquidity is forced to confront these macro headwinds directly. The friction is palpable: high asset valuations (SP500, BTC) are being undermined by deteriorating risk-appetite and currency market instability.",
    "action_stance": "Cautious",
    "optional_deep_insight": "The current environment is a textbook example of a breakdown in the Global Financial Cycle, with the USD/JPY acting as the canary in the coal mine. The 'CRITICAL SHOCK' likely signals a rapid tightening of shadow liquidity as carry trades are unwound, a process that can starve risk assets of capital far quicker than official central bank policy changes. This explains the disconnect between high index levels and weakening internal momentum; the largest components are holding up the average while the periphery begins to crumble.\n\nThis is a moment to overweight specific, acute signals (the shock event) over broad, lagging indicators (the aggregate risk score). The divergence between these two is not noise; it is the primary signal. The strategic implication is to reduce broad market beta and potentially increase exposure to volatility instruments or specific FX strategies designed to capitalize on the JPY's move. We are shifting from a state of stable risk to one of imminent transition, and portfolios must be positioned accordingly.",
    "clarity_level": "Low",
    "summary_sentence": "The market's calm surface, reflected in the low risk score, is being fractured from below by a critical currency shock, demanding vigilance over complacency."
